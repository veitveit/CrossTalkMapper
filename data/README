## Mouse Tissues Dataset ##
###########################

# published: Accumulation of histone variant H3.3 with age is associated with profound changes in the histone methylation landscape
# 4 tissues (brain, heart, liver, kidney)
# 5 time points (3, 5, 10, 18, 24 months)
# 2-4 biological replicates (3, 5, 10 months: 4 replicates for each tissue and time point, 18 + 24 months: 2 replicates for each tissue and time point)
# 2 technical replicates for each biological sampe, but these are averaged already in CrosstalkDB

# Download all datasets with PRIDE dataset identifier PXD005300 from CrosstalkDB (http://crosstalkdb.bmb.sdu.dk/)
# Search --> choose "original data" and enter "PXD005300", click "search" --> export entire table as csv (mouse-tissues_ctdb.csv)

# map CrosstalkDB dataset IDs to tissues and based on these add columns containing time points and biological replicates to file
# Brain:
# CrDB000062 .. CrDB000081			## notice: there is a gap between 63 and 68... for the other tissues, the ranges fit
# Heart:
# CrDB000082 .. CrDB000097
# Liver:
# CrDB000098 .. CrDB000113
# Kidney:
# CrDB000114 .. CrDB000129
